# Unexpected Results with Case-Insensitive Regex in MongoDB Queries

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with case-insensitive regular expressions in MongoDB queries.  In some scenarios, using the case-insensitive flag (`i`) with regular expressions might not produce the expected results, especially when combined with other operators or if the regex engine has limitations.

The `bug.js` file contains a query that uses a case-insensitive regular expression to find documents.  In some MongoDB versions or configurations, this may lead to unexpected results.

The `bugSolution.js` file offers a workaround or provides an explanation of how to resolve this specific behavior.

## How to Reproduce

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Set up a MongoDB connection (you will need to adjust the code in both files with your MongoDB connection string).
3.  Run `bug.js`. Observe the results.
4.  Run `bugSolution.js` to see a possible solution or alternative approach.

## Potential Solutions

Solutions often involve careful review of the regular expression syntax and possibly avoiding the case-insensitive flag if possible.  Using alternative approaches such as converting strings to lowercase before comparison might resolve the problem in some instances.  Another way may be using the $regex operator with the $options flag explicitly specifying the 'i' for case-insensitive search.
